# A dead simple webpage

The simplest web page in the world consists of a single file.

It doesn't need to be called `index.html`, you can call it anything you want. But that is the comon lore.

It is a text file, mening you can see the content with any text editor you want.
It is written in a language called HTML, in particular HTML5.

That is a markup language. Other markup languages you might have heard of are markdown (this very readme is written in markdown) and Latex.

As you can see it is compsed of something called *tags* or *elements*. Such as `<body>` or a paragraph `<p>`.

Some of these tags you need to explicitly close like the above mentioned `<body>` or `<p>`, but you will see that not all of them need to be closed that way.
For instance the rule for including an image is:

`<im src="my_image.png">`

There are many tags you will need to learn. But some comon tags:

* `body` and `head`, they are present in all documents
* `p` indicates a paragraph
* `div` and `span` are some of the most used tags to indicate a generic element.
* `h1`, ..., `h6` they are called header elements
* `im` to insert a immage.
